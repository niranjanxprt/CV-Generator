            <strong>Learning Plan:</strong> I'm committed to rapidly building MedTech domain expertise through structured learning (FDA/MDR frameworks, ISO 13485, design controls), customer immersion (shadowing R&D and RA teams at partner companies), and leveraging REMATIQ's platform as learning tool. My technical foundation, customer-facing experience, and proven ability to master complex domains position me to become a valuable centre of excellence while delivering immediate impact on customer success and product innovation.
